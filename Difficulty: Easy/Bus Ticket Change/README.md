Each bus ticket costs <strong data-start="206" data-end="217">5 coins</strong>, and <strong>arr[i]</strong> denotes the note a passenger uses to pay (which can be <strong data-start="287" data-end="303">5, 10, or 20</strong>). You must serve the passengers in the given order and always provide the correct change so that each passenger effectively pays exactly <strong data-start="444" data-end="455">5 coins</strong>. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to serve <strong data-start="518" data-end="536">all passengers</strong> in the queue without ever running out of change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>arr[] = [5, 5, 5, 10, 20]<br><strong>Output: </strong>true<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.<br>From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.<br>From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.<br>Since all customers got correct change&nbsp;we return&nbsp;true.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input: </strong>arr[] = [5, 5, 10, 10, 20]<br><strong>Output: </strong>false<br><strong>Explanation:</strong> From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills. For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill. For the last customer, we can not give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills. Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.</span></pre>
