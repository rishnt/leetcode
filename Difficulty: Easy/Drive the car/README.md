The car can travel "k" kilometers on each sub-track. If the car can't cover a sub-track, you can add petrol, with each unit increasing the car's range by one kilometer. Return the <strong>minimum units of petrol</strong> needed for the car to cover all sub-tracks. If no extra petrol is required, return<strong> -1</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Examples:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input: </strong>arr[] = [2, 5, 4, 5, 2], k = 7
<strong>Output: </strong>-1
<strong>Explanation: </strong>No extra petrol required, as k is greater than all the elemnts in the array hence <strong>-1</strong>.</span></pre>
<pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Input: </strong>arr[] = [1, 6, 3, 5, 2], k = 4
<strong>Output: </strong>2
<strong>Explanation: </strong>You are given 5 sub-tracks with different kilometers. Your car can travel 4 km on each sub-track. So, when you come on sub-track 2nd you have to cover 6 km of distance, so you need to have 2 unit of petrol more to cover the distance, for 3rd sub-track, your car can travel 4km  and you need extra 1 unit of pertrol.So if you add 2 units of petrol at each sub-track you can cover all the subtracks.</span></pre>
